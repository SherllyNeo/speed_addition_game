# speed_addition_game
Simple raylib speed addition game

It will display numbers, and ask you for their total


Change config file
#define BPM 60 - numbers per minute
#define NEGATIVES true - if negative numbers should be allowed
#define AMOUNT_OF_NUMBERS 10 - amount of digits shown before asking for total
#define AMOUNT_OF_DIGITS 1 - amount of digits per numbers

NOTE: 
if negative is false, there are no bounds on how high the total can go
if negative is true, negatives will be added to keep the total below 10
